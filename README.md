# US State-level POST Dataset Analysis

*Overview*
- This repository contains scripts and notebooks for exploratory analysis of state Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) datasets. Our primary focus is on entity matching of names across various state datasets to identify common entities. We leverage Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation and datamatch for efficient and accurate entity matching.

*Objective*
- To analyze POST datasets from different states.
- To perform entity matching on names to identify individuals across multiple datasets.
- To provide insights and patterns that may emerge from cross-state data analysis.

*Usage*
The repository is structured as follows:

notebooks: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive data exploration and analysis.
data: Folder to place the datasets for analysis (not included in the repository for privacy and size reasons).
